SymfonyTutorial
===============

The source code for a Symfony2.5 Tutorial I followed.

###Install instructions
This repository isn't designed to be used by others but in case you want to.

first of all run ``(php)composer(.phar) update`` 
This ensures you have all the correct dependencies.

when that is ready do the following:

copy and rename ``/app/config/parameters.yml.dist`` to ``/app/config/parameters.yml``.
in there edit the database settings to the settings you have locally.
As well as the correct mailer options.
